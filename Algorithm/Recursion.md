# Recursion

### Algorithms

- Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs
- Algorithms allow us to use these data structures to perform actions on that data.
- Algorithms are simply steps in a process that we take to perform a desired action with computers.

An algorithm is a set of commands that must be followed for a computer to perform calculations or other problem-solving operations.

Big O is really important as companies get larger and larger. By learning these listed algorithms(Sorting, Dynamic Programming, BFS + DFS, Recursion), we are able to do majority of the scaling we need to improve our programs.

Certain algorithms allow us to simplify our big complexity into smaller or better time complexity.

### Recursion

Not an algorithm is a concept.

If I want to find a specific file, I canâ€™t do it by just looking at one folder. I want to look at folders recursively to find the file.

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems.

It is essential to know that we should provide a certain case in order to terminate this recursion process. So we can say that every time the function calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.

### Steps

1. Define a base case: Identify the simplest case for which the solution is known of trivial. This is the stopping condition for the recursion, as it prevents the function from infinitely calling itself.
2. Define a recursive case: Define the problem in terms of smaller subproblems. Break the problem down into smaller versions of itself, and call the function recursively to solve each subproblem.
3. Ensure the recursion terminates: Make sure that the recursive function eventually reaches the base case, and does not enter the infinite loop.
4. Combine the solutions: Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.
