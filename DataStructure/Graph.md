# Graph

- A non-linear data structure consisting of vertices(nodes) and edges.
- A power tool for representing and analyzing complex relationships between objects or entities.

Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent relationships between different entities. Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, solving various problems like finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

### Types of Graphs

1. **Directed VS Undirected**

Directed Graph: A graph in which edges have a direction (ex: webpages)

Undirected Graph: A graph in which edges have no direction (ex: social network such as Instagram)

1. **Weighted VS Unweighted**

Weighted Graph: A graph in which edges have weights or costs associated with them(ex: road network)

Unweighted Graph: A graph in which edges have no weights or costs associated with them(ex: social network)

1. **Cyclic VS Acyclic**

Cyclic Graph: A graph with at least one cycle(ex: bike-sharing graph)

Acyclic Graph: A graph with no cycle
